The Font Hinting option is used to select how fonts are displayed in the PDF Editor. Choose As Windows if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on Windows, i.e., using Windows font hinting. Choose As OS X if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on a Mac, i.e., without any font hinting at all. Choose Native if you want your text to be displayed with hinting embedded into font files. Default cache mode - used to select the cache mode for the font characters. It’s not recommended to switch it without any reason. It can be helpful in some cases only, for example, when an issue in the Google Chrome browser with enabled hardware acceleration occurs. The Document Editor has two cache modes: In the first cache mode, each letter is cached as a separate picture. In the second cache mode, a picture of a certain size is selected where letters are placed dynamically, and a mechanism for allocating/removing memory in this picture is also implemented. If there is not enough memory, a second picture is created, etc. The Default cache mode setting applies the two above-mentioned cache modes separately for different browsers: When the Default cache mode setting is enabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the second cache mode, other browsers use the first cache mode. When the Default cache mode setting is disabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the first cache mode, other browsers use the second cache mode.

Printing To print out the current PDF, click the Print icon in the left part of the editor header, or use the Ctrl+P key combination, or click the File tab of the top toolbar and select the Print option. The Firefox browser enables printing without downloading the document as a .pdf file first. Adjust the following parameters in the Print window that opens: Destination - choose the destination of the printed file, e.g., Save to PDF, Microsoft XPS Document Writer, Microsoft Print to PDF, Fax, etc. Pages - choose one of the options for printing the pages: All, Current, Odd, Even, or Custom. In the latter case, you will have to enter the number of pages manually. Colour mode - choose whether you want your file printed in Colour or Black and white. Please note that this setting is available when the Microsoft XPS Document Writer Destination parameter is selected. For the Fax Destination parameter, the colour mode is set to black and white by default. Click the More settings caption to open advanced settings. Paper size - select one of the available sizes from the drop-down list or set a user defined one. Scale - set the file scaling when printed; you can fit it to page width or set the scaling manually via the Scale checkbox and the corresponding input field. Pages per sheet - set the number of pages printed on one sheet, e.g., two, six, nine, etc. Margins - define the page margins. You can choose either default margins or custom ones measured in inches. For custom margins, please set the required values for top, bottom, left and right margins manually. You can also choose the None option to have no margins. Options - check the Print headers and footers checkbox to have them printed, or uncheck this box to have no headers and footers printed. Print using the system dialogue - click this caption to open the system dialogue to configure the printing process. In the desktop version, the available printing settings are Print range, number of Pages, Copies, Print sides, Page size, Page orientation, and Margins. You can also print the file to PDF or use the Quick print button in the top toolbar to print the file on the last selected or default printer."
